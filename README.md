# Pokemon Remix Studio Scraper

[PokeRemixStudio](https://www.youtube.com/c/PokeRemixStudio) is a nostalgic youtube channel that creates remixs of pokemon music.  The creator provides all their songs on [their website](https://www.lycanroc.net/music/?g=pokeremixstudio).  Downloading every song is a tedious task manually so I scripted it. 

To run.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scraper.py
```

This script will download each mp3 to a folder called music.
